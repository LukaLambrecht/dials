# Notes
#
# 1. This docker-compose is not production-ready, you should use it only for development puporses
#    if do not want to run the entire stack natively
#
# 2. This file assumes that PostgreSQL and Redis are running as standalone docker containers
#    as describe in backend's README, so we need to set network_mode to "host"
#    in any application that need to communicate with those containers.
#    Optionally you can modified it yourself an run PostgresSQL and Redis from it and remove the network_mode
#    but make sure to expose all the necessary ports and check the links between containers
#
# 3. This file also assumes that DQMIO files are stored under the path "/mnt/dqmio" in the host
#    you can modify this location as you wish, remember to also modify the path in .env
#    if the application is also going to look for the files anywhere else
